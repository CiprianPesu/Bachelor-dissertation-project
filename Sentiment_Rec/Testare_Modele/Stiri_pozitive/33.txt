New year,
New hope
It goes without saying that the world was turned upside-down last year as we faced a global pandemic, racial reckoning and the continued effects of climate change. However, we at BBC Travel believe the dawn of 2021 brings with it a new sense of hope and possibility – as well as a heightened sense of connection to each other and the world around us.

Even as we were – and still are – unable to travel in the way we did before the pandemic, people from different cultures in every continent have continued to thrive in their personal corners of the planet, bringing joy, passion and inspiration to their communities. They've preserved local traditions, made strides to protect the Earth, and used their creative talents to expand and evolve their cultures.

With BBC Travel's 50 Reasons to Love the World in 2021, we hope to share that joy with you, and through their extraordinary stories, inspire you to fall in love with the world all over again. After all, it's the only one we have.

We asked 50 remarkable people – both known voices and unsung heroes – the question, “Why do you love the world?” Scroll to discover what they had to say…
