(CNN)Despite perfecting the coconut-and-caramel combo of Samoas and the chocolate-covered breath mint that is a Thin Mint, it took decades before the bakers behind Girl Scout Cookies brought us their own version of a fudgy brownie.

It's ironic, considering that an entire rank of young scouts are known as Brownies. But now, the chocolatey dessert is finally about to be incorporated into the iconic Girl Scout Cookie portfolio.
The scouting organization just announced that Adventurefuls, chocolate cookies filled with a hefty dollop of "caramel-flavored cr√®me and a hint of sea salt" -- and topped with a chocolatey drizzle -- will debut starting in January 2022, when the burgeoning businesswomen of Girl Scouts begin peddling their desserts.
Food & Wine editor Adam Campbell-Schmitt, who sampled Adventurefuls a few months before they're available to the masses, said the cookie tastes pretty much as advertised -- and that the salty caramel helpfully cuts the sweetness of the cookie.
Adventurefuls are the third new Girl Scout Cookie since 2020: The 2021 cookie season saw the debut of Toast-Yay!, a French toast-flavored offering adorably shaped like a miniature piece of bread. And the year before that came Lemon-Ups, crispy lemon wafers stamped with positive affirmations like "I Am a Go-Getter."
Whether the flavor profile of Adventurefuls is truly adventurous remains to be tasted by the rest of us, but it'll be simple to score a box when they arrive: During the pandemic, the Girl Scouts of the USA implemented a digital cookie-buying platform to keep scouts and customers safe (though some regions saw a surplus of unsold boxes this year). Buying Adventurefuls may even help a scout score a Cookie Business badge.
