It is unlikely that Bahrain's interior ministry band has played the Israeli national anthem much before - but they practiced it to perfection.

The song rang out with an honour guard in the courtyard of Al-Qudaibiya Palace - home to the ruling Al-Khalifa monarchy. I watched and then saw smiles swapped in the sunshine between Israel's Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad.

This was a scene unthinkable a few years ago. So was Mr Bennett's welcome on Monday night - an Israeli leader and Gulf royalty mingling over a red carpet, feted under airport floodlights.

But already it was starting to feel less remarkable. Normalisation is becoming normal.

Mr Bennett's trip to Bahrain is the second to a Gulf country in as many months. He went to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in December. Both Arab states have signed trade and defence "framework" agreements with the Israelis. A year and a half has passed since the "Abraham Accords" began, now extending to four Arab countries.

They were brokered by US President Donald Trump and signed in 2020 by then-Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr Bennett, keen to escape his predecessor's shadow, sees his job as moving them from "ceremony to substance".

On Monday, the departures board at Ben Gurion airport listed two flights to Dubai and one to Abu Dhabi. Ours to Bahrain involved airport security, prime minister's security, having your passport taken away and a two-and-a-half-hour flight - including over Saudi Arabia - before landing in Manama.

The Bahraini capital is an impressive grid of skyscraper hotels, malls and financial services. Oil replaced pearls as the wealth driver in the 20th Century. Now it's just a fifth of the economy, and like its neighbours Bahrain is diversifying to survive.

Mr Bennett met the country's finance, foreign and transport ministers, and held talks with the King and Crown Prince. Their officials said the mission was to achieve "peace, stability and prosperity".
