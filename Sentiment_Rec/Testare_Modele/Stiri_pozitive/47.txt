(CNN) â€” Many people stay put most of November in anticipation of the money and time they'll spend on the impending Thanksgiving, Hanukkah and Christmas holidays. But you may want to rethink that idea.
Because it's off or "shoulder" season for numerous destinations, there are plenty of deals to be had and discounted flight and hotel rates to enjoy. Also, the Southern Hemisphere is starting to warm up in November, as it enters late spring, while the Northern Hemisphere is cooling off in temperature and travel intensity.
If you can get away in November, either before or during the holiday, you'll find plenty of moderate weather, thinning crowds and bargain prices.
In no particular order, here are five marvelous places to consider in November:
November is the beginning of high season in the hottest big city in the USA. But because the season is just starting up, you'll likely get some relief from the peak prices in winter while still escaping the heat of peak summer temps.
Here are a few only-in-November events:
-- Arizona International Auto Show: If autos get your motor humming, this is the place to be. You can see hundreds of cars from dozens of manufacturers. November 28 through December 1, 2019. (100 N. 3rd St., Phoenix, Arizona 85004; +1 602 262 6225)
-- Azcentral Wine & Food Experience: This is a must-attend event for fans of Martha Stewart things -- or really anyone who enjoys good food and wine. November 2-3, 2019. (16601 N. Pima Road, Scottsdale, Arizona 85260; +1 480 502 0815)
-- Fountain Festival of Fine Arts and Crafts: The festival started up in the 1970s and is one of the largest of its kind in the Southwest. Enjoy paintings, other artwork, jewelry, local food and more. November 8-10, 2019. (Avenue of the Fountains, 12925 N. Saguaro Blvd. Fountain Hills, Arizona; +1 480 837 1654)
Let's look at some outdoor options since the summer furnace is off. (Heads up: You'll likely need a jacket at nights -- deserts can get quite cold, too):
-- Desert Botanical Garden: This is an excellent place to take a walk and learn more about the surprisingly varied plant life of the desert. (1201 N. Galvin Pkwy., Phoenix, Arizona 85008; +1 480 941 1225)
-- Camelback Mountain: You can partake in an inspiring mountain hike here, just 20 minutes from downtown Phoenix. Just be warned: Its two trails are considered quite difficult. Echo Canyon trail is the steeper one, and you'll need to use hand rails and pull yourself over boulders. (N. Echo Canyon Pkwy, Phoenix, Arizona). Cholla Trail is the longer one. (6131 E. Cholla Lane, Phoenix, Arizona 85253).
-- Goldfield ghost town: It's hard to resist a good ghost town out West. Come pan for gold, ride a narrow-gauge railroad and see what saloons were like back in the late 1800s. (4650 N Mammoth Mine Road, Apache Junction, Arizona 85119; +1 480 983 0333)
If you're a Frank Lloyd Wright follower or just like a good home tour, be sure to check out Taliesin West. It was Wright's winter home and is considered one of the most personal of the architect's works. (12621 N Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd, Scottsdale, Arizona 85259)
Phoenix has some fine museums, and that include the Heard Museum, which is devoted to the works and cultures of Native American tribes. (2301 N Central Ave, Phoenix, Arizona 85004; +1 602 252 8840)
Phoenix and its environs (particularly Scottsdale) are known as resort and spa country. Here are a couple of suggestions:
-- Omni Scottsdale Resort & Spa at Montelucia: You might feel like you've traveled to the Andalusia region of Spain when you arrive here. The resort's Joya Spa offers massages, facials, meditation and naturopathic services such as IV therapy. (4949 E. Lincoln Dr., Scottsdale, Arizona 85253: +1 480 627 3200)
-- The Phoenician: Enjoy golf, fine dining and of course, the spa. From the rooftop pool to the tranquility room, the emphasis is on relaxation. You can even get your own specialized blend at the aroma bar. (6000 E Camelback Road, Scottsdale, Arizona 85251; +1 480 941 8200)
November in Rome marks the beginning of the off season. The days (and lines) are shorter, a bit chillier and possibly wet.
If you plan accordingly, this can be a lovely time to visit, though: As temperatures drop, so do flight and hotel prices, and if the weather is not the most pleasant, there are plenty of indoor activities to partake in with a lot fewer people. A few rainy-day ideas:
-- Pantheon: Built by Emperor Hadrian between 118 and 125 A.D., it was for the worship of every god. In 609, it was converted to a Christian Church. In a city of many amazing ancient sites, this is one of the top. (Piazza della Rotonda, 00186 Roma RM, Italy; +39 06 68300230)
-- Ara Pacis Museum: This museum has an interesting history, both ancient and recent: It is built around a sacrificial altar commissioned by Emperor Augustus dating to 9 B.C. while the new museum surrounding it dates to 2006. (Lungotevere in Augusta [corner via Tomacelli] - 00186 Rome)
-- Nuovo Mercato Esquilino: Peruse the stalls at this indoor international market. You can buy anything from fresh fruit to clothes. It's a great place for people-watching. (Via Filippo Turati, 160, 00118 Roma RM, Italy)
Many museums and archeological sites around Rome, including the Colosseum, are free on the first Sunday of each month, while the Vatican Museums are free on the last.
If you catch Rome on a nice afternoon, take in a sunset view at Gianicolo Hill, one of the more overlooked sights in Rome. You can take a taxi up to the viewing terrace, soak up the view then walk down to Trastevere for dinner.
A couple of suggestions:
Get a pizza alla napoletana at Pizzeria Nerone. (43, Via del Moro, 00153 Roma RM, Italy; +39 06 5830 1756).
Or, if you prefer Roman-style, check out the ever-popular Pizzeria ai Marmi. (Viale di Trastevere, 53, 00153 Roma RM, Italy; +39 06 580 0919)
While it's great that peak tourist season has come to an end in November, what's more important is that wild boar hunting and truffle season has begun. Which means menus throughout Rome will showcase these two delicacies. Not much of a wild boar hunter? Take a day trip from Rome to Umbria for a truffle hunt instead.
If that wasn't enough to keep you busy, check out the Romaeuropa Festival. This multidisciplinary and cultural arts fete with international participation hosts events from September 17 to November 24, 2019.
