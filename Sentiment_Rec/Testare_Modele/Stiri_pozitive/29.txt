During an interview on "Mornings with Maria" Mortgage Bankers Association board member Jeff Taylor said the housing market is the "strongest it's ever been," coming off of a red-hot $3.9 trillion purchase market in 2021.

JEFF TAYLOR: So right now, the housing market's probably the strongest that it's ever been. We're coming off a $3.9 trillion year in 2021. And as we head into 2022, the key stat that we're looking at is we're projecting a $1.7 trillion purchase market. To get perspective, this is the strongest purchase market in the last 25 years. And with home equity at all-time record highs at $23 trillion, this is as strong across the nation as we've seen the housing market in the last couple of decades.
